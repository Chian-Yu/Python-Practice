    "Welcome! At this point, you've seen a number of ways of automating the process of data acquisition, analysis, and visualization. You've also worked your way through the basics of object-oriented programming using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know how to, for example, use pandas to load up a csv, the Arc API (or geopy) to geocode addresses found in that CSV, and then Folium to quickly generate an interactive web map of that data. You also know how to use iteration to parse through large, repetitive data sets to pull out the information you need (remember how many 'uncles' there were?).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's still ***a lot*** more to learn and programmatic spatial data analysis and visualization is a ***constant*** process of learning new libraries while simultaneously deepening your understanding of others. It can feel daunting, but it's also a lot of fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enough pre-amble!\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, *you've learned quite a lot*. This lab is a chance to show off the skills you, lock down those that make the most sense ***in your workflow***, and learn new ones along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I'm going to give you a problem, an outcome, and tell you where to find some data. The rest is up to you. We'll have two 'themes' and a series of questions that relate to each theme. At the end, you'll produce a visualization. These problems are *contrived*, but designed to force you to acquire, process, and visualize data in ways not unlike those that you'll likely face moving forward."

A couple of notes: 1. The State level House of Representatives is the **lower** chamber and WA's number code is 53 (how would you find this out yourself?) 2. The Tacoma data is **much** easier (in my opinion) to access via the open-data API that it uses.\n",

But this analysis does not consider the fire size, the neighborhood council with the least fire rate is not equal to they has the least loss in the fire.\n",

    "Factor 2: **Fire loss rate per bar per year** provides the estimated property loss per bar in each neighborhood council per year. I joined the attribute of the factor 1 result to compare. The rank is a bit different from factor 1. Central has the least property loss in fire incidents but its rank of fire rate per bar per year is third. Because the fire data only records the total fire incident amounts, both the result of factor 1 and factor 2 could not represent the risk of fire in or influence the bar.\n",

    "In factor 3,**Bar per square kilometers** provides the density of the bar in each neighborhood council. The smaller value means fewer bar per square kilometers. The West End has the smallest density. But this analysis does not consider the population, the neighborhood council with the smaller bar density might mean fewer people willing to go to the bar in this area or the population in this neighborhood council is smaller.\n",

    "Factor 4: **Fire rate per square kilometers per year** provide the result of the fire occurred rate per square kilometers in each neighborhood council per year. North East is the place with the lowest fire rate. I think the analysis is relatively objective because it does not consider the bar amount. If I only want to find a place to minimize my risk of fires, North East will be a great choice."
