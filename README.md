# Python-Practice
There are four labs in this repository that are assignments in TGIS 501, all of them are code by python.

## [Lab3: Data, Functions, and Classes](https://github.com/Chian-Yu/Python-Practice/blob/main/Huang_lab3.ipynb)
In this lab, I learned how to use the for loop ,basic use of geopandas, and interactive Leaflet map via Folium.

## [Lab4: ArcGIS API for Python and Plotly Express](https://github.com/Chian-Yu/Python-Practice/blob/main/Huang_lab4.ipynb)
In this lab, I learned how to use the ArcGIS API to anaylize and make a map, and interactive map via Plotly.Express.
*Note: This lab could not view in the github page. It should download and open via jupyter notebook.

## [Lab5: Tacoma Businesses](https://github.com/Chian-Yu/Python-Practice/blob/main/Huang_lab5.ipynb)
In this lab, I used the skill learned in the previous labs finish four maps by Folium,Plotly.Express.

## [Lab6: Clustering using KMeans and Hierarchical clustering](https://github.com/Chian-Yu/Python-Practice/blob/main/Huang_lab6.ipynb)
In this lab,I learned how to use KMeans and Hierarchical to determine the best number of clusters. The data came from Iris dataset.
